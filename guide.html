          <p>The Map</p>
          <p>The map is divided into 32 sectors, 4 of which are landmarks. A sector may be owned by at most 1 player, and it may contain at most 1 unit.</p>

          <p>Landmarks</p>
          <p>A landmark is a special kind of sector. If a player owns a landmark, a new unit will spawn at the landmark at the start of the player's turn, assuming there is not a unit already on the landmark. In addition, each landmark is associated with a specific type of resource, and the player who owns the landmark also owns 2 of the landmark's associated resource.</p>

        <p>Units</p>
        <p>Units are a player's instrument with which to capture sectors and eliminate other players. New units spawn at Level 1, and may progress up to Level 5. Each time a unit successfully captures a sector, its level increases by 1. A unit's level determines its overall strength - a higher-level unit is more likely to win conflicts with other units.</p>
        <p>When a unit reaches level-5, it becomes a Postgraduate Unit. This is a special kind of unit that can teleport to any sector you own.</p>

        <p>Resources</p>
        <p>There are two types of resources: Beer and Knowledge. Beer boosts a player's offensive power, while Knowledge boosts a player's defensive power.</p>

        <p>When the game starts, each player owns one landmark that contains a single level-1 unit. Which player owns which landmark is determined randomly. Players then take turns moving their units and starting conflicts with other players. </p>
        <p>A player is considered eliminated when they have no units left AND they do not own any landmarks. The game ends when only one player is not eliminated, and that player is the winner.</p>
